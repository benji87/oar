He would be straight at my door if i rang him with something i didn&amp;#39;t understand. I actually thought of him more of out friend then our actual agent. he was lovely and new his stuff. Did not try to blag us with anything at all. I almost went for a solicitor online which i am so glad i never did because my buyers went for one on line and have had nothing but trouble with them. Anyway when i told John i was about to go with one online ... he convinced me not to and told me why and the problems i could have with it and he made a phone call for me and put me onto a very good solicitor. So happy i listened.

It simply did not attract any interest, not one enquiry let alone a viewing. From my experience I think YOPA probably works if you are prepared to sell your house at a price lower than it is worth but if you want to get local people through the door a local agent is better and they are also more likely to help you achieve a better price.', ''),

My comments are not a matter of opinion - they are a matter of fact (although having spent 20 years plus buying,selling and letting property I consider myself far more experienced than these people are). Eventually they stopped answering my calls and emails until the listing was due for renewal. Needless to say I didn&amp;#39;t return their calls!!\r\nEasyproperty demonstrated 2 things. First they are incompetent. Secondly they don&amp;#39;t give a damn. This isn&amp;#39;t surprising given they are paid upfront and if the property fails to sell or let, so what. They charge you another renewal fee. They therefore benefit from failure as the longer the property is on the market the more listing fees they can charge.

Further changes to description and photos take a day to take effect. I received details from interested parties via email/text and would then contact them to arrange a date and time for viewing. Saturdays was the most popular day. I&amp;#39;d let the viewers into the property to view by themselves then after 10 minutes I would walk in and talk to them and answer any questions in a professional manner. I advised them that any offers be passed to the estate agent as its best not to get too personal when talking about money.

The splurge of hyperbole coming out of his gob was so outlandish that I would have been forgiven for thinking I was about to purchase Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\nIt was with this in mind that I was first drawn to online estate agents and particularly Sell My Home, who, from what I read during my research, are by a long way the leading online estate agent in the London market with the best knowledge of the intricacies specific to it. Their business model is simple: in this day and age, with the progression of the internet, everybody&amp;#39;s primary tool when it comes to house hunting are online search engines. At the click of a button, you can see every property on the market within a 100 mile radius of your chosen area if you so choose. The market is a million times more transparent than it was 10 years ago - we can compare prices, square footage, area, outdoor space, proximity to transport and so forth and so on and everybody but everybody knows to within a few thousand pounds what their property in nominally worth - especially in London where the turnover of properties is enormous. So why pay a traditional estate agent 1-2% of the value of your property when you can do 99% of their job yourself. Online estate agents such as Sell My Home charge a very small flat fee to gain you access to all the online property portals and all you have to do in return is conduct your own viewings.\r\n\r\nWith the estate agent who had sold me my home fresh in my memory, so it was I signed up with Sell my Home to sell my property. Some might consider doing your own viewings a hassle but when you consider the amount of money you are saving - you are essentially working for &pound;1000/hr or more depending on the value of your property. And best of all, your buyers will not be driven to despair by some pimply faced pre-pubescent unqualified idiot in an ill fitting suit declaring that your &amp;quot;kitchen sells itself&amp;quot; or that your small box room &amp;quot;oozes period charm&amp;quot;. The truth is a nice house does sell itself and instead of wasting your breath telling potential buyers about it, you can equip them with all the important information that a traditional estate agent rarely knows such as when the boiler was installed, what the neighbours are like, how much monthly utility bills are and just generally give them an idea of what it is like to actually live there.\r\n\r\nMy own major concern with online estate agents was that there would not be anyone helpful at the end of the line/answering emails who would be able to give me advice along the way. With Sell My Home, that could not have been further from the truth. Behind what is a very sleek website which provides an incredibly easy online account from which you arrange all your viewings and see any offers you receive as they come in, there is a highly qualified, incredibly personable and helpful sales team and every client is assigned their very own personal account manager. My own was called Harry and he was contactable 24 hrs a day 7 days a week. He was helpful at every step of the process, offering advice on setting the price, helping me to organise viewings and suggesting ways to making them easier to manage such as holding open days etc etc. He negotiated the sales price for us and once we were under offer dealt with all the solicitors, other estate agents and surveyors so that I didn&amp;#39;t have to. In short, he made the entire process from start to finish as easy as it could possibly have been and ultimately was the reason it was such a success.\r\n\r\nAnd if you are wondering about results. From going online, we received multiple viewing requests in the first week and had two offers within 7 days of being on the market, one of which was at the price that we needed. The buyers were far from easy - nervous first time buyers with a truly incompetent lawyer and Brexit happened a week after we accepted their offer but somehow Harry kept them on board and we exchanged a couple of days ago and are now looking to complete in early September less than 3 months after the property first went live.\r\n\r\nAnd that isn&amp;#39;t even the best bit - as a result of using Sell My Home, whom I think did a better job than a traditional estate agent would have done anyway, I have saved myself close to &pound;12,000. Without that saving, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to afford to purchase the house that I eventually chose.\r\n\r\nSo fingers crossed we complete now and I am sure with Sell My Home in my corner - exchange to completion will be as stress-free as possible.\r\n\r\nIf you need any more persuading to go online and specifically with Sell My Home next time you are selling a property, then look no further than the &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; estate agents who marketed the house that I have just exchanged contracts on. Their salesman told me the house had two garages when I first looked round it - however, it turned out that they were both attached to the house next door and the one I was looking at in fact had none! The vendors must have been paying close to &pound;20,000 for that extraordinarily poor level of service.\r\n\r\nSo the mantra that you pay peanuts and get monkeys is not always true. Some monkeys come at a price far higher than a couple of peanuts. However, with Sell My Home, you do pay peanuts but what you get in return is a very inventive online platform behind which sits a slick, professional, highly qualified sales team which has identified a flaw in an old fashioned, outdated market and found a way to bring it into the 21st Century to the benefit of us all. Thank you Sell My Home.', ''),

There was a huge outcry from &amp;quot;Traditional&amp;quot; Estate agents we had discussions with about using &amp;quot;online&amp;quot;, during our own purchasing process. Doom mongering and dissuading us regarding our flirtation with the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot;. But being contrary folk and looking for a fix we jumped into the deep end going for the full packing with the Sellmyhome team. \r\n\r\nYou have to assess any business decision on the Risks and ROI. The risk with Sellmyhome is exceptionally low, you have most channels to market through digital these days, and most estate agents who have tried to sell us into seeing homes in the past had missed the mark and wasted our time - so the traditional sell that you get additional viewings can be true but it&amp;#39;s a false economy. People are particular with their future &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; and largest capital investment, they know what they want and what they can afford. So whilst footfall is important, you want the right people viewing your property, the the price is therefore also essential - a number of traditional agents massively overvalued our property to try and get our business which would have been a waste of our time. Sellmyhome set the price after a solid diagnostic on the actual sales (vs price listings) in our market (Putney) and therefore priced our house as it should have been. This demonstrated that defining the risks can be different. \r\n\r\nThe ROI however is huge and obvious, fundamentally we would, AND NOW HAVE, saved in the region of &pound;14,000 on our sale. No brainer. \r\n\r\nAside from the the technicalities of a sale process comes the single most important part of any &amp;quot;services or &amp;quot;middle man&amp;quot; business. CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. \r\n\r\nFrom the clarity of packages available to us (bespoke offerings for everyone), to getting the marketing/photography done (which was the best we&amp;#39;ve had), to most importantly the consultation/analysis of the sale price; all were conducting accurately,  professionally, transparently and with ease of contact and timeliness. Just what we wanted, nothing is a hassle to them. \r\n\r\nFrom here on in the process was great. Technology underpins every successful company these days and the platform Sellmyhome use to ensure you are on top of viewings, up to speed on offers, questions, you name it it provided it. We were constantly in the loop through automated emails OR your account manager calling you with more complex issues. The technology combined with polite, available and market savvy staff is a brilliant combination. \r\n\r\nFinally and an piece that few recognise as a huge plus point, is the access to your buyer. I spoke regularly with my purchaser, which is not something our last Estate Agent wanted or in fact allowed last time around. It makes the whole process run smoother. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean the team weren&amp;#39;t there when needed to offer professional advice during the negotiating process. But small issues get ironed out faster.  \r\n\r\nSuffice to say we received an offer at asking price (among other offers) after 4-5 working days. We&amp;#39;ve now sold. \r\n\r\nGreat work team and please all use Sellmyhome.co.uk', ''),

Even the 2 weeks we did have a traditional agent made me realise how much better the online system is compared to the traditional way of doing things.

I was won over by the promises of free accompanied viewings and free tenancy agreement all chargeable according to the website. On the day photographs were taken and a listing was sent to me for approval. It was hardly three amateur sentences and did not capture a good description of my property. Still feeling optimistic I took it upon myself to write a description and the agent uploaded it. I asked for the EPC to be added which never was done! Since that day I never heard anymore from the agent and no news of any viewings. After 2 weeks I sent an email saying since I was getting concerned please reduce the rental price. This was actioned but no acknowledgement from that email. A week later in week 3 I called the office and asked for an update on my property. I was told there had been no interest. I asked if it was possible to have my money back and was told no. I asked her to remove the ad and this was done immediately. I never heard from anyone again at Hatched and the lady I spoke to didn&amp;#39;t even ask me why I wanted the ad removed. It was a total waste of &pound;94. I know their response will be that they are not in control of customer interest however there is no excuse for no communication and since dropping hatched I went to openrent which is completely free and my property tenanted within a week. Please stay away from using Hatched to rent your property unless you don&amp;#39;t mind losing &pound;94.', ''),

House went on the market and sold within 3 weeks. Minor negative is she was late on the first open day, but on the positive I can call, email or even text Hollie when ever I want . Not bound by opening hours of offices or speaking to others in the estate agent and missing post-it notes... it&amp;#39;s 19:30 and Hollie is still messaging me! Amazing service, especially since I sometimes work odd hours it&amp;#39;s so useful for me.\r\n\r\nA slight improvement to the service is ability automatically accept viewings and/or block out calendar like you get on purple bricks (I think....) but since I paid the fee for hosted viewings it was Hollie&amp;#39;s problem to deal with!\r\n\r\nIn all, less than a grand and house is sold quicker than any other house in my area at a price above what I was expecting.

At this point we were faced with the decision to sell or let out, and after deliberating the pros and cons, we eventually settled on the prospect of having to let the house using a letting agency. \r\n\r\nAs any prudent customer would, we began the arduous task of researching the market and doing our homework. And as you are well aware there are a plethora of options to consider! We eventually shortlisted 4 options (High street agent, Hybrid Online agent (self-proclaimed), Online agent (Easy Property) and Rent Guarantee estate agent) and carried out a detailed assessment of the total costs (upfront, hidden and recurring) before speaking individually with each agency and then making our decision. Long story long, we ended up with Easy Property only because of Danielle Russell, whom I cannot speak highly enough of.  Danielle (Lettings executive) and Gina Bishop (Property Management) played a crucial role in alleviating our concerns of dealing with a virtual company. Danielle and Gina were able to answer each and every question (read as interrogation) I threw at them. I am not an expert, but thanks to google, have a fair appreciation of the pitfalls of letting, and I am pleased to advise they fared much better than any of their counterparts at other letting agencies. \r\n\r\nI have had many interactions since with Danielle, who went above and beyond my expectations in securing a tenant within hours of the property going online. The guidance provided was useful considering my inexperience with lettings (also the tenants inexperience!)\r\n\r\nI have since had to deal with Ellie (Customer care), who has also been very prompt in responding and following up my queries. It has been a pleasure dealing with all of them, and I look forward to continuing the same experience with the rest of your team involved in the process. \r\nI will absolutely consider using EasyProperty in the future, and would not hesitate to recommend them to others!', ''),

My sister sold through Yopa as a result of our experience and she too sold within days for the full asking price!
